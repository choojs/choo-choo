Welcome to `choo-choo`, a workshopper designed to teach you _choo_, a tiny
web framework that runs completely in your browser! In this first exercise,
we're going to set up your local environment so that you can hopefully
breeze through these exercises!

The good news is: If you have `choo-choo` installed globally, then you don't
need anything else! (there's no bad news, too.) We've built a starter kit that
helps you get going in no time, and it's all built into `choo-choo`.

To install the starter kit, just type:

```sh
choo-choo install <path>
```

Where path is the directory you want to install the kit to. After it's set up,
move into the directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd <path>
npm install
```

Then, open your favorite editor and look at the files, particularly the
`welcome.js` file in order to finish this exercise!
