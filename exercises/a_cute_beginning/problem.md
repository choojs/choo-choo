Welcome to `choo-choo`, a workshopper designed to teach you _choo_, a tiny
web framework that runs completely in your browser! In this first exercise,
we're going to set up your local environment so that you can hopefully
breeze through these exercises!

The good news is: If you have `choo-choo` installed globally, then you don't
need anything else! (there's no bad news, too.) We've built a starter kit that
helps you get going in no time, and you can use it thanks to npm!

To install the starter kit, just type:

```sh
npx create-choo-app <path>
```

Where path is the directory you want to install the kit to. After it's set up,
move into the directory:

```sh
cd <path>
```

Then, you can open your editor and have a look at the files. Don't worry if
not everything is clear at first, that what we're going to be working on in the
next exercises. To pass this exercise, just run:

```sh
choo-choo verify
```
