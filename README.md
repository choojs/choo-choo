A [workshopper] that teaches you about [choo].

## Installation

You need the latest stable [Node.js] release to run this workshopper!

```sh
npm install -g choo-choo
```

Then, just run `choo-choo`, select the first exercise, and you're good to go!

## Work In Progress

This workshopper is in active development. There's currently only a couple of
exercises, but we're working on pushing out more. If you want to help out,
have a look at [how to contribute](#contributing)!

## Contributing

In order to get a basic local setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/choojs/choo-choo
cd choo-choo
npm install
```

It's recommended that you run `npm link` so that you can use the `choo-choo`
command globally, but still symlinked to your development folder. This makes
testing exercises much easier.

- `npm test`: runs the standard style linter
